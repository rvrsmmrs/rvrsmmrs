s👋 Hey, nice to meet you! I'm River!

## About Me

🎓 I am a first-year at UNC-Chapel Hill. I intend to double major in Computer Science and Biostatistics. I want to explore the intersection between computer and health sciences, and I hope to study bioinformatics in the future.

🔎 I plan to get involved in research here at UNC as soon as possible. I am currently looking to get involved in computational health research in Chapel Hill. As a member of the AI Club at UNC, I am working on a convolutional neural network to locate ecDNA from medical imagery. In high school, I researched fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) at the ECU neuroscience lab as a part of the SVSM program.

👨‍🦯‍➡️ I am also passionate about accessibility! I want to help make digital spaces more accessible to people with disabilities.

🎸 Outside of class, I play guitar, draw, paint, and woodwork. If you are looking for a guitarist for a rock/grunge/alt band let me know!

## Classes

💻 COMP 110 - While I already have a strong foundation in python, I am taking the introductory computer science course at UNC.

🔧 COMP 290 - Hey TAs! I've learned a lot about important computer science tools, including git and docker, which have already been extremely useful in my own projects.

📈 Math 233 - Learning the basics of linear algebra and vector calculus has greatly helped my understanding of machine learning concepts.
